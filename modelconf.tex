In this study, we used the F compset of the ACME model, in which the atmosphere and land models are active 
with the data ocean model and thermodynamic sea ice model. The atmosphere model is version 5 of the Community 
Atmosphere Model (CAM5) with the advanced spectral element dynamic core. In order to study the 
ENSO effects on the ecosystem, we activate the biogeochemistry component of the ACME land model. The sea surface
temperature (SST) and ice concentration are provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
high resolution (1/4~$^{\circ}$) daily optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) for contemporary era. For future predictions, 
they are provided by the ensemble 9-month seasonal forecasts from NOAA Climate Forecast System (CFS) version 2 and 
the climatology reconstructed from historical observed SST. For simplicity, the horizontal grids of all ACME model 
components are the cubed sphere grid of ne30np4, approximately 1 by 1 degree.
